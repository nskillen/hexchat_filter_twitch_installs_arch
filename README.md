# HexChat Filter for Twitch Installs Arch Linux

This is a simple plugin that filters out command messages from the Twitch IRC chat to make it possible to read.
Uses the list of commands from https://github.com/twitchinstallsarchlinux/twitch-master/blob/master/map.json

Also adds a few 'fake' commands that people commonly think are commands, so far 'dash' and 'minus'
Maybe I'll add the ability to set your own so that you can adjust on-the-fly

Requires that you selected Python 3.x scripting support when you installed HexChat
